# Products API

## Locations

Product services are split across:

- `src/core/api/services/products/product-crud-api.ts`
- `src/core/api/services/products/product-sections-api.ts`
- `src/core/api/services/products/product-lessons-api.ts`
- `src/core/api/services/products/product-download-files-api.ts`
- `src/core/api/services/products/products-api.ts`

`products-api.ts` re-exports the product service modules.

## Types

Current frontend product types are `COURSE`, `DOWNLOAD`, `CONSULTATION`, and `MEMBERSHIP`.

Current product statuses represented in frontend types are `DRAFT`, `PUBLISHED`, and `HIDDEN`.

Membership uses the shared Product create/update shape for core Product fields only. There is currently no Product API payload for Membership-native Posts, Videos, Resources, included Product relationships, recurring pricing, feed ordering, readiness state, or Membership publishing.
